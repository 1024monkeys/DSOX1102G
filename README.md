# DSOX1102G
Keysight DSOX1000 series python visa interface.

Requires pyvisa: https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

This code supports a subset of the available commands.  
However, new commands would be easy to add.  
Just follow the same pattern, and keep the 1000_X-Series_prog_guide.pdf handy.

There's no gui.  Console interface.

I used the USB interface.  Presumably other visa interfaces would work as well.
